               <p>One of the country’s oldest festivals, Moriones, locally known as “Moryonan”, 
                   has become synonymous to the province of Marinduque. Held annually during the Holy Week,
                    Moriones is widely celebrated by both locals and tourists. Local participants dressed in Roman soldier 
                    uniform march down the main road connecting the towns of Gasan, Boac, Mogpog, and Santa Cruz. Usually, the two largest towns 
                     Boac and Santa Cruz present the reenactment of the moment when an unnamed Roman soldier (a blind “Moryon”), 
                     struck Jesus in his side with a lance while crucified on the cross and was able to see after the blood droplets from the wound touched his eyes.

              <p> <br><br> Walking along the streets of Marinduque, you can still see ancestral houses that depict influences of Spanish colonial time, 
                  as well as the native Filipino house “bahay kubo”. You’ll also notice other architectural influences in every churches in the provinces
                   If you’re into archaeology, Marinduque is an archaeological site, it provided vital archaeological finds about Philippines pre-Spanish 
                   era.<br><br><br><br>
                   Marinduqueños are considered to be hospitable and very welcoming. One such proof to that claim,
                    is the tradition of putong or tubong. A custom of welcoming and honoring friends and visitors. 
                    It is also a form of thanksgiving and prayer for a long and blessed life. <br><br><br><br>
                   Another uniquely Marinduque, is the version of Tagalog spoken by its inhabitants. It has been described as “the root from which modern national forms of speech have sprung,” where remnants of archaic Tagalog could be found. If this linguistic theory is accurate, Marinduque’s Tagalog has contributed significantly to the development of the official Philippine national language. Even to this date, Marinduqueños speak a variation of Tagalog that is very similar to the way that Tagalog was spoken before the Spanish colonization.

              <h3 >How To Get there and go around</h3>
              <p> Marinduque can be reached by air from Manila via Asian Spirit Airlines which flies 3 times a week. 
                 These flights bring the visitor to Gasan.  Another way to reach the province is by bus to the Port of Lucena in 
                  Quezon then by ferry to either Balancan Pier or to Buyabod Pier.  Private vehicles can also be brought to the province
                   via the same route using the roll-on/roll-off ferries.  From the pier, vans or passenger jeepneys take you to your hotel.  Jeeps,
                    tricycles as well as vans-for-hire are widely available for going around the province.
